= Timeout Setting

The checks are performed with a timeout. The default timeout is set by the `{element_timeout_seconds}` property.

With the following annotation, the check can be optimized for all UiElements during page instantiation:
[source,java]
----
@PageOptions(elementTimeoutInSeconds = 60)
public class ExamplePage extends Page {
	// insert your code
}

= Error handling (*deprecated*)
Exceptions caused by `@Check` annotations can be catched by overwriting the `checkPageErrorState()` method in the concrete page class.
This is an example how to overwrite the checkpage error inside a created page class.

[source,java]
----

@Override
protected void checkPageErrorState(Throwable throwable) throws Throwable {
    // insert your code
}

----

This method body for example could throw other exceptions or write something in the log. +

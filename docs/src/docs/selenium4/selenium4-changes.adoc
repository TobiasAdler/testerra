= Important changes

The Selenium devs provide a short https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/upgrade_to_selenium_4/[migration guide] for Selenium 4 ().

The following subsections describes how the changes affect Testerra.

== Custom capabilities

Any capability that not in the standard of https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/#capabilities[W3C] needs a vendor prefix.



== Global capabilities

== Browser version

Be aware of using a browser version if you execute your test against a standalone Selenium 4 server. This is running as a local grid which knows nothing about any local browser versions.

Your test will run into a timeout!

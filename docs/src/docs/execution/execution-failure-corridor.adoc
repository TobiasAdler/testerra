= Failure Corridor
include::../properties/property-attributes.adoc[]

This mechanism is used to define the test goal of test runs so that it only fails with an invalid failure corridor.

This feature is enabled by default with the following property.

[source, properties, subs="attributes"]
----
{failure_corridor_active}=true
----

With an enabled failure corridor, you need to define the maximum amount of failures per weight:

.test.properties
[source, properties, subs="attributes"]
----
{failure_corridor_allowed_failed_tests_high}=0
{failure_corridor_allowed_failed_tests_mid}=1
{failure_corridor_allowed_failed_tests_low}=2
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not define any failure corridor, the default value `0` is used for all three levels.
====

To change the weight for each test, just annotate it with `@FailureCorridor`, where `High` is default.

.Examples of method weighting
[source, java]
----
// This testcase is marked with a high weight.
@FailureCorridor.High
@Test
public void test1() throws Exception {
    Assert.fail();
}

// This testcase is not marked, but the default weight is high.
@Test
public void test2() throws Exception {
    Assert.fail();
}

// This testcase is marked with a middle weight.
@FailureCorridor.Mid
@Test
public void test3() throws Exception {
    Assert.fail();
}

// This testcase is additional marked with @Fails.
// So the test result is ignored by the Failure corridor.
@Fails
@FailureCorridor.Mid
@Test
public void test4() throws Exception {
    Assert.fail();
}

// This testcase is marked with a low weight.
@FailureCorridor.Low
@Test
public void test5() throws Exception {
    Assert.fail();
}

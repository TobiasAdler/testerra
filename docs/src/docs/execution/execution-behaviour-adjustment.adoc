include::../properties/property-attributes.adoc[]

.test.properties
[source, properties, subs="attributes"]
----
# all browser windows remain open after first failure, default = false
{on_state_testfailed_skip_shutdown}=true

# skip all tests after first failure, default = false
{on_state_testfailed_skip_following_tests}=true

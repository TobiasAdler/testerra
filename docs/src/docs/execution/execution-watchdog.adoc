= WebDriverWatchDog
include::../properties/property-attributes.adoc[]

The `WebDriverWatchDog` is your vigilant pet watching the test execution and reacting on blocked tasks. With two properties it is set up.

.test.properties
[source, properties, subs="attributes"]
----
# activate watchdog, default = false
{watchdog_enable} = true

# timeout in seconds after the test execution is terminated, default = 300
{watchdog_timeout_seconds} = 500

----

== How does it work?
With the first Usage of `WedDriverManager` the `WebDriverWatchDog` is initiated.
It internally starts a Thread running in parallel to the current test execution checking the stacktrace every ten seconds for
stacktrace entries with thread name "Forwarding" containing an Element "java.net.SocketInputStream".
These potentially blocking stacktrace entries are updated every time found.
Upon reaching the maximum timeout of 500 seconds the whole test execution is terminated with exit code 99 and a readable error output in your log.

NOTE: A valid report is always generated.

= Regular Assertions

When implementing the `AssertProvider` interface, you get an instance named `ASSERT`, which provides more features than standard TestNG `Assert`

You can use this interface for assertions they cannot be covered by the UiElement.

[source,java]
----
import eu.tsystems.mms.tic.testframework.testing.AssertProvider;

public class MyTest extends TesterraTest implements AssertProvider {

    @Test
    public void test() {
        ASSERT.assertContains("Hello world", "planet");
    }
}
----

This will throw an `AssertionError` with the message `Expected [Hello world] contains [planet]`.

You can also add some more detailed information to the subject.

[source,java]
----
ASSERT.assertContains("Hello world", "planet", "the greeting");
----

Which will result in `Expected that the greeting [Hello world] contains [planet]`

Please take a look into the `Assertion` interface for a full feature overview.

= Waiters

In testing practice the test automation code must tolerate delays caused e.g. by page loading or javascript activities when checking conditions on UiElements.

If the condition (which is checked continuously) is met within the timeout
then the wait methods return true.

Otherwise, after the timeout has passed they return false without any further
action or assertion.

----
boolean result;
result = element.waitFor().displayed(boolean);

// Overrides preconfigured internal timeout
result = element.waitFor(int seconds).displayed(boolean);

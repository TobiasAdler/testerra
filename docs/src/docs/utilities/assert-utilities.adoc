= Assert Utilities  (*deprecated*)

NOTE: This class has been replaced by the <<Regular Assertions, Assertion interface>>, therefore marked as `@deprecated` and should not be used anymore.

This class provides some extra assertion methods for TestNG:

[source,java]
----
AssertUtils.assertContains("Hello World", "Martin", "Greeting");
// Greeting [Hello World] contains [Martin] expected [true] but found [false]

AssertUtils.assertContainsNot("Hello World", "World", "Greeting");
// Greeting [Hello World] contains [World] expected [false] but found [true]

AssertUtils.assertGreaterEqualThan(new BigDecimal(2), new BigDecimal(4), "High number");
// High number [2] is greater or equal than [4] expected [true] but found [false]

AssertUtils.assertLowerThan(new BigDecimal(2), new BigDecimal(-1), "Low number");
// Low number [2] is lower than [-1] expected [true] but found [false]

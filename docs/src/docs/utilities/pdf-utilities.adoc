= PDF Utilities

This is an utility class for handling and retrieving information from PDF files, such as text content or the amount of pages.

== Extracting text

It is possible to extract text content of whole PDF documents or just one specific page for verifications.

[source,java]
----
// reads text from a file given by a filename (absolute path of file).
String textFromPdf = PdfUtils.getStringFromPdf(String pdfFileLocation);
----

[source,java]
----
//reads text from only one page of a pdf given as input steam.
String textFromPdf = PdfUtils.getStringFromPdf(InputStream stream, int pageIndex);

== Exporting images

It is also possible to use methods of this class to render an image for one specific page of the PDF or export the entire document to multiple images.
That way you can save reference images and use them for visual comparison of PDF files by using the `assertImage` method of <<#_layout_check, Layout Check>>.

= Report customizing

Some aspects of ReportNG can be customized. Have a look for the complete list of <<_report_properties, all properties>>.

== Code snippet in method details

In case of using helper methods for assert test aspects it could be useful to get the source code line of the _calling_ method, not the helper method itself.

You can exclude packages or classes with a regex definition:

.test.properties
[source,properties]
----
# Exclude all packages or classes which names contain 'abstract' or 'foo', ignoring case sensitives
tt.report.source.exclusion.regex=(?i:abstract|foo)
----

The following image shows the differences between default (left) and `tt.report.source.exclusion.regex=AbstractSourceCodeTests` (right).

NOTE: Setting this value as <<_test_local_properties, a local test property>> will be ignored because source code snippets are only collected at the end of the whole test.

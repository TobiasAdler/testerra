= Overview

Testerra provides an advanced reporting of the test results with the `Report-NG` module.
A report generated with `Report-NG` consists of these different views:

* Dashboard - a general overview of the test run
* Tests - a detailed list of the individual tests
* Failure Aspects - a summary of the different types of failures
* Logs - a panel that contains detailed logging information
* Threads - a graphical view of the thread activities during the parallel test execution

The report is generated after the test execution and can be viewed with this html file:

[#ExecutionAbortion]
In case of unexpected abortion of a test execution the report is generated, too. . Due to abortion of still running test methods
some information can be missing, like result states or execution time.

Testerra additionally provides a mechanism to implicitly create a test report when an unexpected exit of the current execution occurred. All existing information created until the moment of the abortion are collected to generate a report.
This might lead to missing as information like the execution time, result states and screenshots might be abandoned if running test methods have been interrupted.

A hint indicating the possibly incomplete state of the report is shown as a warning in the section 'priority messages'.
The report generation in case of abortion of the test execution is described in detail in the paragraph <<#JvmExitHook, JVMExitHook>>.

====
Unfortunately, because the report is a highly dynamic application based on java script, the security settings of most browsers do not allow to directly view the report in your local folder. In this case you can use one of the simple http servers from https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255[this list] to serve the files and to access the report.

= Setup

The simplest way to add Report-NG test reports to your project is to use the Testerra project skeleton as a foundation.
See <<Testerra Skeleton project>> how to start with it.
You can use Report-NG instantly because there it is already configured for use with Maven as well as Gradle.

If you are not using the Testerra skeleton, checkout the Maven and Gradle build files in chapter xref:gettingstarted/manual-steps.adoc#_setup[Testerra manual setup].

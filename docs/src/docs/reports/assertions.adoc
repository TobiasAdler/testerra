== Assert Collections for Functional Asserts

When an <<#_assert_collector_of_functional_asserts, Assert Collector>> is used and some of its assertions fail the test is not aborted, but it will be marked as failure in `Report-NG`:

The failures are marked in the step view:

== Optional Asserts

When <<#_optional_asserts, Optional Asserts>> fail, the test will also be fully executed and will be marked as passed.

The failed optional asserts will be displayed as warnings (non functional errors):

= Failure Aspects View

In case of many failures it is important to be able to find out the most severe failure reasons (aspects) that caused the most failed tests cases.

For this the Failure Aspect View was designed.

It comes with a filter as well and shows the most occurred problems on the top with the number of tests that they caused to fail.

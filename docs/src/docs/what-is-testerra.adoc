****
It is an integrated Java framework for automating tests for (web) applications. Testerra can also be understood as a building block for test automation projects with various basic components.

Testerra is based on Selenium but makes it much easier to create your automation solution to test your application.

The framework is developed by our Test Automation Experts at T-Systems MMS in Dresden (link:https://test-and-integration.t-systems-mms.com[Website]). In numerous projects Testerra is used as the standard test automation framework and includes the experience of more then 10 years of test automation.

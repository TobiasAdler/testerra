Project setup recommendations.

== Normalize file encoding

Always use the same file encoding for all your source file types like `.html`, `.properties`, `.java` etc.

IntelliJ: You can change the default encoding for files at _File -> Settings -> File Encodings_

== Normalize file endings

Prevent using default line ending `CRLF` on Windows.

Git: Setup `git config --global core.autocrlf input` to prevent any commited CRLF.

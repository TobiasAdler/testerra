= Browser capabilities

You can customize your WebDriver session by setting capabilities in the following ways:

- Global capabilities that affect every WebDriver session created and can be set by <<User agent configuration>>
- <<Request capabilities>> that affect only WebDrivers for a given request

When creating a new WebDriver, these capabilities get merged together in this exact order.
